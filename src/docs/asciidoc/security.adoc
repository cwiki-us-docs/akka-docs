== Receiving Security Advisories

The best way to receive any and all security announcements is to subscribe to the [Akka security list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security).

The mailing list is very low traffic, and receives notifications only after security reports have been managed by the core team and fixes are publicly available.

== Reporting Vulnerabilities

We strongly encourage people to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Following best practice, we strongly encourage anyone to report potential security
vulnerabilities to [security@akka.io](mailto:security@akka.io) before disclosing them in a public forum like the mailing list or as a GitHub issue.

Reports to this email address will be handled by our security team, who will work together with you
to ensure that a fix can be provided without delay.
